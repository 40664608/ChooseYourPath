    <h2>Bear Encounter</h2>
    <p>As you follow the path, you hear noises behind you in the bushes. Suddenly, a large bear emerges, growling and approaching you. You start to shake in fear but react quickly, and you start running.</p>

    <p>While running, you notice a shed off to the side of the path. You quickly rush inside, slamming the door behind you. The bear growls and scratches at the door, but the shed seems sturdy enough to keep it out.</p>

    <p>After a while, the bear loses interest and walks away. You survived the encounter, but. What do you do next?</p>
